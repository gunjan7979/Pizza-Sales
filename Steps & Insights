I am excited to share a recent project I completed on Pizza Sales using SQL and Power BI. 📶 

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞: To develop a comprehensive set of queries and dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze store sales effectively.



Steps Performed:

Importing data from csv files to SQL database.

Wrote SQL queries for different questions asked from different stakeholders.

Made Power BI Dashboard to have dynamic view of the data.



PDF of SQL Questions and Answers shared.

Dax Query used in Power Bi:

1. Date = LOOKUPVALUE(orders[date],orders[order_id],order_details[order_id])

2. Current_Day_orders = CALCULATE(

    DISTINCTCOUNT(order_details[order_id]),

    FILTER(

        All(order_details),order_details[Date] = max(order_details[Date])))

3. Current_Day_Revenue = CALCULATE(

    Sum(order_details[Revenue]),

    FILTER(

        All(order_details),order_details[Date] = max(order_details[Date])))

4. Revenue = order_details[PRICE1]*order_details[quantity]

5. Previous_Day_orders = CALCULATE(

    DISTINCTCOUNT(order_details[order_id]),

    FILTER(

        All(order_details),order_details[Date] = max(order_details[Date])-1))

6. Previous_Day_Revenue = CALCULATE(

    Sum(order_details[Revenue]),

    FILTER(

        All(order_details),order_details[Date] = max(order_details[Date])-1))

7. PRICE1 = LOOKUPVALUE(pizzas[price],pizzas[pizza_id],order_details[pizza_id])

8. Size1 = LOOKUPVALUE(pizzas[size],pizzas[pizza_id],order_details[pizza_id])

9. pizza_type = LOOKUPVALUE(pizzas[pizza_type_id],pizzas[pizza_id],order_details[pizza_id])

10. Pizza_name = LOOKUPVALUE(pizza_types[name],pizza_types[pizza_type_id],order_details[pizza_type])



Data Insights:

1. Total number of Orders are 21.4K  and Revenue is $817.9K in an year.

2. Quarter3 (July, August & September) has the highest order count i.e., 5.44k.

3. Quarter4 (October, November & December) has the lowest order count i.e., 5.12k.

4. Quarter2 (April, May & June) has the highest revenue i.e., $208.4k.

5. Quarter4 (October, November & December) has the lowest revenue i.e., $199.1k.

6. Highest Orders and Revenue came in the month of July i.e., 1.9k and $72.6k.

7. Lowest Orders and Revenue came in the month of October i.e., 1.9k and $72.6k.

8. A dip in Revenue can be seen in three months which are February, September and October.

9. Highest Selling Pizza is Large Sized Pizza, followed by Medium and Small.

10. Top 5 highest Ordered Pizzas are Classic Deluxe, Barbeque Chicken, Hawaiian, Pepperoni and Thai Chicken.

11. Top 5 highest Revenue giving Pizzas are Thai Chicken, Barbeque, Classic Deluxe, Hawaiian and Pepperoni.

12. All these insights can be seen on quarterly and monthly level as well by just using the slicer and month name on graph.
